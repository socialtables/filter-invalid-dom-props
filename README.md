# Filter Invalid DOM Props

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/socialtables/filter-invalid-dom-props.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/socialtables/filter-invalid-dom-props)

Formerly `filter-invalid-dom-props` on npm. Now `@socialtables/filter-invalid-dom-props`.

A simple helper function to filter out invalid dom properties. Useful when spreading into at html element in react applications (and maybe for other things).

## Use

```js
import filterInvalidDOMProps from "@socialtables/filter-invalid-dom-props";
const properties = {
	onClick: () => {},
	value: "cool",
	type: "text",
	christophercolumbus: "notcool"
};
const filteredProps = filterInvalidDOMProps(properties);
/* returns
	{
		onClick: () => {},
		value: "cool",
		type: "text"
	};
*/
```
